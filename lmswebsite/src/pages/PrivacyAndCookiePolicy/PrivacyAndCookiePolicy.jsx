intimated to you through an email sent to your provided email address.
As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you

employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by 
members inside and outside the Firm. We follow generally accepted industry standards to 
protect the Personal Information submitted to us and information that we have accessed.
